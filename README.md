# Who am I?

I'm NicoCraft31 (internet Nickname), and I like a lot programming, videogames and those things.
I like programming because it lets you make things you probably couldn't do in the real world.
Still, though, I still like the real world, it's cool.

# Is there anything you have to know about me?

Not really, but just to let you know, I like Quevedo, the rapper, and Michael Jackson just a little bit.
