# Who am I?

I'm NicoCraft31 (internet Nickname), and I like a lot programming, videogames and those things.
I like programming because it lets you make things you probably couldn't do in the real world.
Still, though, I still like the real world, it's cool.

# Is there anything else you may know about me?

Not really, but I like A LOT music (just listening to it) and I like another things like Maths.
